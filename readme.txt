This is a project that I did so that I can practice more vanilla Javascript

I also did this project so that I can practice some HTML and CSS

I don't know yet how you guys will comment on my work but any feedback to make me better will be taken.

I think that I should do more translations today, something easy.

Today I want to add a part where when I click the <a> about tag it would hover me to the about section
will do research about this part.

Found out that it is called smooth scrolling but I found a Jquery version. I just want to do vanilla version of javaScript to do it.

added objects where I think would be able to help to scroll smoothly. I will try it right now.

I found out how it works but now I want to do that if I click the hyperlink I will smooth scroll to the about div

changed scope of project to become my portfolio website to show what kind of things I can do with this webpage.

Today I will sleep earlier so that I can have more time tomorrow in making changes in this personal project

7:21 am
Good morning I woke up early today around 5 am and started working around 6 am
Today I started making a new section in this webpage which is a timer
Trying to learn the DOM and cleaning up my code so that there would be not so much javaScript on my html pages
Doing this sanity check so that my head can wrap around the idea behind creating buttons in my stop watch.

8:03 am
Finished the layout of the timer

note: Today I finished my stopwatch but I want to only display numbers 0 - 99 for milliseconds maybe tomorrow
      or another time haha.

How do you picture coordinating and communicating with a team if youâ€™re not in the same location?
I picture it via zoom or any software that has the capability of communicating. It could be through emails, calls, texts, and video calls;

What will you do if there is a time sensitive problem with a project and the rest of your team is offline?
I will have to call them through their cell phone numbers if they are offline. 
If they can't be reached I will try to contact the project manager. If I am the project manager I will try to contact
the person who can help solve the problem.

What are some distractions that you anticipate in your remote workplace? How will you avoid them?
House chores, family, and the internet. For house chores it would not be avoided but a time will be set for it, advisable time would be before 
or after the shift. For family, there are some unavoidable distractions but ground rules can be placed during the work shift. For the internet
there are extensions which block websites so that you would not be able to go to them during work hours. This would help so that the I can focus 
on the task on hand.
