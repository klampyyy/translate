Vincent's Dev Logs!



This is a project that I did so that I can practice more vanilla Javascript

I also did this project so that I can practice some HTML and CSS

I don't know yet how you guys will comment on my work but any feedback to make me better will be taken.

I think that I should do more translations today, something easy.

Today I want to add a part where when I click the <a> about tag it would hover me to the about section
will do research about this part.

Found out that it is called smooth scrolling but I found a Jquery version. I just want to do vanilla version of javaScript to do it.

added objects where I think would be able to help to scroll smoothly. I will try it right now.

I found out how it works but now I want to do that if I click the hyperlink I will smooth scroll to the about div

changed scope of project to become my portfolio website to show what kind of things I can do with this webpage.

Today I will sleep earlier so that I can have more time tomorrow in making changes in this personal project
