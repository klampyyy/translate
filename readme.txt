Vincent's Dev Logs!

This is a project that I did so that I can practice more vanilla Javascript

I also did this project so that I can practice some HTML and CSS

I don't know yet how you guys will comment on my work but any feedback to make me better will be taken.

I think that I should do more translations today, something easy.

Today I want to add a part where when I click the <a> about tag it would hover me to the about section
will do research about this part.

Found out that it is called smooth scrolling but I found a Jquery version. I just want to do vanilla version of javaScript to do it.

added objects where I think would be able to help to scroll smoothly. I will try it right now.

I found out how it works but now I want to do that if I click the hyperlink I will smooth scroll to the about div

changed scope of project to become my portfolio website to show what kind of things I can do with this webpage.

Today I will sleep earlier so that I can have more time tomorrow in making changes in this personal project

Good morning I woke up early today around 5 am and started working around 6 am
Today I started making a new section in this webpage which is a timer
Trying to learn the DOM and cleaning up my code so that there would be not so much javaScript on my html pages
Doing this sanity check so that my head can wrap around the idea behind creating buttons in my stop watch.
